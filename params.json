{"name":"CVD Final Project","tagline":"","body":"# GIUSEPPE TERRAGNI\r\n**Giuseppe Terragni** (April 18, 1904 â€“ July 19, 1943) was an Italian architect who worked primarily under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and pioneered the Italian modern movement under the rubric of Rationalism.\r\nHis most famous work is the Casa del Fascio built in Como, northern Italy, which was begun in 1932 and completed in 1936; it was built in accordance with the International Style of architecture and frescoed by abstract artist Mario Radice. In 1938, at the behest of Mussolini's fascist government, Terragni designed the Danteum, a monument to the Italian poet Dante Alighieri structured around the formal divisions of his greatest work, the Divine Comedy. \r\n\r\n![Giuseppe Terragni](http://spazioweb.inwind.it/alessandroarchi/Giuseppe_Terragni.jpg)\r\n\r\nFor this final project I've draw some Terragni's operas like:\r\n\r\n* The Novocomum Table\r\n* The Chair for Sant'Elia nursery school\r\n* A Library prototype\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n## The Novocomum Table\r\n\r\nCoffee table in burr oak characterized by three tops. The Novocomum Table was part of the furniture designed by the Italian designer for the headquarters of the Federation of Farmers, building Novocomum.\r\nThe cost of this table is about 2.000 Euro.\r\n\r\nThis is the REAL table:\r\n\r\n![Real Novocomum Table](http://i39.tinypic.com/14bl56s.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd this is the table shape that I've draw:\r\n\r\n![Shape of Novocomum Table](http://i41.tinypic.com/30dl7di.png)\r\n\r\nFor this shape I've decided to produce it with a final function that draw all the model, inside this function there are some basilar component (cuboid and closed cylinders) created using the parameters gived to the function.\r\n\r\nTo realize this shape I've used this functions:\r\n\r\n1. Circle\r\n2. Cylinder (edited for obtain close cylinders)\r\n3. Cuboid\r\n4. Color\r\n5. T\r\n6. R\r\n7. S\r\n8. Novocomum (writed for parameterize the shape)\r\n\r\nThe Novocomum function has as parameters the radius and the height of the table, then it produce a shape of the table.\r\n\r\nThis is the code of the edited version of the cylinder function:\r\n\r\n\r\n    function CYLINDER(r,h){\r\n    var domain1 = DOMAIN([[0,2*PI], [0,r]])([36,1]);\r\n    var mapping = function(v){\r\n    var a = v[0];\r\n    var r = v[1];\r\n    return [r*COS(a), r*SIN(a)];\r\n    };\r\n    var base = MAP(mapping)(domain1);\r\n    var domain2 = DOMAIN([[-2*PI,2*PI]])([70]);\r\n    var crc = circle(r);\r\n    var model = MAP(crc)(domain2);\r\n    var cil = EXTRUDE([h])(model);\r\n    var cylinder = STRUCT([base,cil,T([2])([h])(base)]);\r\n    return cylinder;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to the source code: [Novocomum Table](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/420076/blob/master/final-project/javascript/novocomum.js)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Chair for Sant'Elia nursery school\r\n\r\nThe Sant'Elia nursery furniture is the last Sant'Elia challenging for Terragni.\r\nThis chair was used to furnish this nursery school\r\n\r\nThis is the REAL chair:\r\n\r\n![REAL Sant'Elia nursery school chair](http://www.ilquintuplo.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/3627_ciac_foligno_terragni_04_sedia.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd this is the chair shape that I've draw:\r\n\r\n![Shape of Sant'Elia nursery school chair](http://i39.tinypic.com/2pob9co.png)\r\n\r\nFor this model I've decided to draw all the model proceeding step-by-step starting from the top and ending to the bottom of the chair. The majority of the chair's support is realized using Bezier's curves.\r\n\r\nTo realize this shape I've used this functions:\r\n\r\n1. Circle\r\n2. Cylinder (edited for obtain close cylinders)\r\n3. Cuboid\r\n4. Color\r\n5. T\r\n6. R\r\n7. S\r\n8. Bezier\r\n9. Intervals\r\n10. Rotational_surface\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of this chair shape, was to draw all the support for the chair. I've realized the back support for the backrest using Rotational_surface:\r\n\r\n    //BACK SUPPORT\r\n\r\n    var p1 = [[2,0,2],[1.98,0,1.85],[1.78,0,1.85],[1.8,0,2]]\r\n    var c1 = BEZIER(S0)(p1)\r\n    var mapp1 = ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(c1)\r\n    var s1 = MAP(mapp1)(rot_domain)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    var p2 = [[2,0,2],[1.98,0,2.15],[1.78,0,2.15],[1.8,0,2]]\r\n    var c2 = BEZIER(S0)(p2)\r\n    var mapp2 = ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(c2)\r\n    var s2 = MAP(mapp2)(rot_domain)\r\n\r\nThe rest of the chair's support was realized using Bezier, because it's not possible to draw the support by turning it on a specific angle but it's necessary to draw it point-to-point with Bezier curves like this:\r\n\r\n    //ARMRESTS\r\n    \r\n    var p3 = [[2,-1,2],[1.98,-1,1.85],[1.78,-1,1.85],[1.8,-1,2]]\r\n    var c3 = BEZIER(S0)(p3)\r\n    \r\n    var p4 = [[2,-1,2],[1.98,-1,2.15],[1.78,-1,2.15],[1.8,-1,2]]\r\n    var c4 = BEZIER(S0)(p4)\r\n    \r\n    var s13 = BEZIER(S1)([c1,c3])\r\n    var surf13 = MAP(s13)(Dom2D)\r\n    \r\n    var s24 = BEZIER(S1)([c2,c4])\r\n    var surf24 = MAP(s24)(Dom2D)\r\n    \r\n    var sx_armrest = STRUCT([surf13,surf24])\r\n    var dx_arst = R([0,1])([PI])(sx_armrest)\r\n    var dx_armrest = T([1])([-1])(dx_arst)\r\n\r\n    //FRONT TOP JUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n    var p5 = [[2,-1.15,2],[2,-1,1.8],[1.8,-1,1.8],[1.8,-1.15,2]]\r\n    var c5 = BEZIER(S0)(p5)\r\n    \r\n    var p6 = [[2,-1.15,2],[2,-1.3,2.1],[1.8,-1.3,2.1],[1.8,-1.15,2]]\r\n    var c6 = BEZIER(S0)(p6)\r\n    \r\n    var p7 = [[2.02,-1.15,1.8],[2,-1,1.8],[1.8,-1,1.8],[1.78,-1.15,1.8]]\r\n    var c7 = BEZIER(S0)(p7)\r\n    \r\n    var p8 = [[2.02,-1.15,1.8],[2,-1.3,1.8],[1.8,-1.3,1.8],[1.78,-1.15,1.8]]\r\n    var c8 = BEZIER(S0)(p8)\r\n    \r\n    var s37 = BEZIER(S1)([c3,c5,c7])\r\n    var surf37 = MAP(s37)(Dom2D)\r\n    \r\n    var s48 = BEZIER(S1)([c4,c6,c8])\r\n    var surf48 = MAP(s48)(Dom2D)\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to the source code: [The Chair for Sant'Elia nursery school](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/420076/blob/master/final-project/javascript/sedia%20per%20asilo%20sant'elia.js)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## A Library prototype\r\nThis prototype was drawing by Terragni, but never physically realized.\r\nThis was the last Terragni's project before his death.\r\n\r\nThis is the REAL library:\r\n\r\n![REAL library prototype](http://lightstorage.ecodibergamo.it/media/2009/09/89732_1081199_PROTOTIPO__8774885_medium.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd this is the library shape that I've draw:\r\n\r\n![Shape of Sant'Elia nursery school chair](http://i41.tinypic.com/rjktxe.png)\r\n\r\nFor this shape, I've decided to draw it using some functions created by me (Book_Spaces and Lateral_Shelfs) for drawing the majority of the model.\r\nThe library legs are realized using Bezier's curves.\r\n\r\nTo realize this shape I've used this functions:\r\n\r\n1. Cuboid\r\n2. Color\r\n3. T\r\n4. R\r\n5. Bezier\r\n6. Intervals\r\n7. Rotational_surface\r\n8. Book_Spaces (created for draw the spaces for the books)\r\n9. Lateral_Shelfs (created for draw the lateral shelfs)\r\n\r\nFor this shape, I've created two new functions called:\r\n\r\n* Book_Spaces \r\n\r\n        //Function that draw the library's book spaces\r\n    \r\n        function BOOK_SPACES(panel,n){\r\n\t    var shelf_h1 = T([0,1])([2,-1])(CUBOID([5.1,0.1,1.5]))\r\n\t    var level_1 = STRUCT([shelf_h1,panel])\r\n\t    for (var i = k ; i >= 0; i--) {\r\n\t\t    level_1 = STRUCT([level_1,T([0])([i])(panel)])\r\n\t    };\r\n\t    return level_1\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n* and Lateral_Shelfs.    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n        //Function that draw the library's lateral shelfs \r\n\r\n        function LATERAL_SHELFS(shelf_h0,n){\r\n\t    var closing = T([1])([-0.75])(CUBOID([0.1,0.75,1.5]))\r\n\t    var level_2 = STRUCT([shelf_h0,closing])\r\n\t    for (var g = k-2 ; g >= 0; g--) {\r\n\t\t    level_2 = STRUCT([level_2,T([1])([g*(-0.75)])    (STRUCT([shelf_h0,closing]))])\r\n\t    };\r\n\t    return level_2\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to the source code: [The Library prototype](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/420076/edit/master/final-project/javascript/prototipo.js)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLink to the GitHub project: [GitHub project](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/420076/tree/master/final-project)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
